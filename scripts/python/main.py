Usage:
   setup_environment.sh <one or more setup actions> : run the given setup actions
   setup_environment.sh -h                        : print this screen

   (if no actions are provided, default is "setup-dev-environment")

   Any of the actions below should be referenced as <parent> <child>. So for example, to install
   the prover service deps, "prover-service install-deps".

   Current actions:
   --------------

   - prover-service: 

      - install-deps: install the dependencies for building and running the prover service.

      - add-envvars-to-profile: Add the directory containing libtbb to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Required
        for running the prover service and for running the prover service tests.

   - circuit:

      - install-deps: install the dependencies required for compiling the circuit and building
        witness-generation binaries.


   - trusted-setup:

      - download-latest-setup: downloads latest trusted setup and installs it in RESOURCES_DIR. If
        RESOURCES_DIR is not set, uses the default location "~/.local/share/aptos-prover-service".

      - download-latest-witness-gen-c: downloads the C witness generation binaries for the latest 
        trusted setup and installs it in RESOURCES_DIR. If RESOURCES_DIR is not set, uses the default 
        location "~/.local/share/aptos-prover-service".

      - download-latest-witness-gen-wasm: downloads the wasm witness generation binaries for the 
        latest trusted setup and installs it in RESOURCES_DIR. If RESOURCES_DIR is not set, uses 
        the default location "~/.local/share/aptos-prover-service".

      - run-dummy-setup: Compiles the circuit in this repo and runs a dummy *untrusted* setup 
        based on the result of that compilation. Installs it in RESOURCES_DIR? Is it bad that 
        it will overwrite any existing setup downloaded using trusted-setup:download-latest-setup?

   - misc:
      - compute-sample-proof

   - setup-dev-environment: runs the following tasks:
      - prover-service:install-deps
      - prover-service:add-envvars-to-profile
      - circuit:install-deps
      - trusted-setup:download-latest-setup
      - trusted-setup:download-latest-witness-gen-c
      - trusted-setup:download-latest-witness-gen-wasm
